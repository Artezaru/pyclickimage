Using the GUI
==============

Once the application is running (see :doc:`running_the_GUI`), you can open an image if you haven't already done so.

Opening an Image
-----------------

To open an image, click on the **"Load Image"** button in the GUI.
When a new image is loaded, any previous clicks and groups will be cleared.
If you wish to load previously saved clicks, you can use the **"Load Clicks"** button and select the ``.csv`` file containing the saved clicks.

Adding Clicks
-----------------

To add clicks to the image, simply click on the desired points (left-click) in the image displayed in the GUI.
Right-clicking add a point (None, None) to the image, which can be useful to skip a click.

Managing the Click Groups
--------------------------

The clicks are organized into groups. Initially, there is one default group called **"default"**. All clicks you make are stored in this group unless you decide to create and select a new group.

To manage the groups:

- **Add a new group**: Click on the **"Add Group"** button and select a group name from the dropdown menu.
- **Switch between groups**: You can switch between groups using the **ComboBox** that allows you to choose the active group. When you select a group, any new clicks will be stored in that group.
- **Group name**: At the end of the session, the clicks will be saved in a ``.csv`` file with the group name as the first column.

For example, if you start with the default group, the saved file will contain rows with the group name **"default"**. However, if you create a new group (e.g., **"My_New_Group"**) and select it, the subsequent clicks will be saved under this new group.

Hereâ€™s how the data might appear in the CSV file:

.. code-block:: console

    Group,Index,Click X,Click Y
    default,0,276,97
    default,1,242,109
    My_New_Group,0,317,144
    My_New_Group,1,253,169

The coordinates are in integer format, as PyQt5 does not support float coordinates.
The ``X`` coordinate corresponds to the column index in the image, and the ``Y`` coordinate corresponds to the row index, similar to how you would access pixels in a NumPy array (i.e., `image[Y, X]`).

Removing Clicks
---------------

To remove clicks, you have the following options:

- **Remove the last click**: Click the **"Remove Last Click"** button.
- **Remove all clicks**: Click the **"Remove All Clicks"** button.

Saving the Clicks
-----------------

To save the clicks to a ``.csv`` file:

1. Set the path for the output ``.csv`` file in the **"CSV File Path"** field.
2. Click the **"Save Clicks"** button to save the clicks.

The saved ``.csv`` file will have the following format:

.. code-block:: console

    Group,Index,Click X,Click Y
    default,0,276,97
    default,1,242,109
    My_New_Group,0,317,144
    My_New_Group,1,253,169
